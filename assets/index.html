                This website highlights me as a person through my work experiences and hobbies. I am currently working at a law firm full time and have been working as a real estate agent part time.
                I am looking to transition from my current position at a law firm to becoming a software developer for a cloud based tech company. 
                I fell into coding by creating scripts for my current position at the law firm and then implenting those scripts for my work as a part time Real Estate Agent.

                <p id="back ground description">
                    I started my place in the workforce during college working a retail job at the mall. This was the start of my customer support mentality. 
                    From there I went into the restaurant industry, working part-time while going to college to study for my degree in political science.
                    My trajectory at this time was to graduate college and then go to law school somewhere out of state. I am originally from California but moved to Washington because I had visted some relatives here and fell in love with the area.
                    I looked up law schools in the area and was planning on going to University of Washington or Seattle University. I graduated from CSU San Marcos and then left for Washington.
                    I used my restaurant experience to find a job as a server at a place called Maslow's in South Lake Union. Me being in a new city and just out of college I wanted to take a break from schooling but wanted to make some strides into the career of law. 
                    From this server job at Maslow's I was able to network with individuals and land a job at my first law firm named Cooley LLP as an office assistant. I was looking to gain some insight in the lifestyle of a lawyer.
                    I wanted to see what kind of lifestyle lawyers had before deciding on going to law school. 
                    Working there for about a year I got a great idea of what it was like to be in a large firm. 
                    I wanted to expand my experience and left for a smaller firm (Harrigan, Leyh, Farmer and Thomsen) hoping that the experience would be different from large firms to small firms. 
                    To my dismay, there wasn't a big change in work-life balance for many of these lawyers and with the high cost of law school; I was really put off to the idea of becoming a lawyer.

            <p id="Recrecation description">
                Recreational work includes many things involving real estate, and techonology. Outside of working, some of my main recrecational activities include going hiking, fishing, clamming, and going to the gym. When I am not out into the world I like to spend time with my 2 dogs, Ezekeial and Ezreal where we watch tv shows and movies.

                This application is where I created a simple calendar that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. 
                This app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The basis of this of project was to get the fundamentals in using jQuery in conjunction with HTML and CSS.

                   This timed quiz application helps establish the fundamentals of Javascript. This application has a dynamically implemented CSS and HTML.
                   This code features a timer on the quiz as well as the ability to save the user's high score using local storage. When developed further
                   this application has similar use to a quiz you might find on the internet asking about "What character from a tv show you might resemble?". 
                   It's timer and ability to save locally would allow users to be able to take the quiz while next to each other.

                This application uses third party API's from the website https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api. The purpose of this application is to be able to use and manipulate
                third party API's, while having the CSS and HTML change according to the weather. One of the best exercises in this project was that you needed 2 different API's
                to feed into one another to pull more information from the individual city day chart to the individual city 5-day chart.

                    This application uses an API from IMDB that allows user's with a key to pull movie data from their database. We created this application in order 
                    to figure out what 2 actors are in the same movies together witout having to use google and their expansive search results. We wanted to create a relative small and 
                    concise application for the average movie-goer. For the first project I worked on creating the CSS and HTML for the application along with creating the cards
                    that the results are displayed on.
